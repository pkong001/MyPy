      "Data Modeling\n",
      "Comprehensive, meaningful data analyses are only possible if the data that is mainly in different formats and \n",

      "Enterprise data is collected centrally in the SAP BW ∕4HANA  Enterprise Data Warehouse. Technical cleanup steps \n",

      "evaluations.\n",

      "stored in these InfoProviders in different degrees of granularity in various layers of the data warehouse \n",

      "SAP BW ∕4HANA  system for data provision, Corporate Memory, data distribution and data analysis.\n",
      "InfoProviders are normally made up of InfoObjects. InfoObjects are the smallest (metadata) units in SAP \n",
      "BW∕4HANA . Using InfoObjects, information is mapped in a structured form. This is required for building data \n",
      "stores. To ensure metadata consistency, you need to use identical InfoObjects to define the data stores in the \n",
      "different layers. You also have the option of modeling objects directly from fields however, in cases where you \n",
      "need rapid and agile data integration.\n",
      "You can create logical views on the physical data stores in the form of InfoProviders in order to provide data from \n",

      "The idea of extending and making the solution portfolio of a Data Warehouse more flexible, so that remote data \n",

      "remote data and assign meaning to it. Since all data outside of the BW is defined in the shape of fields, the key \n",
      "prerequisite for a virtual integration of such data lies in field-based modeling on the basis of open ODS views.\n",
      "2.3.2.2 Open ODS View and Logical Data Warehouse\n",
      "The Open ODS view provides a number of functions that are important for establishing logical data warehouse \n",
      "components in a solution:\n",
      "●The accessibility of external data :\n",
      "Every source that is accessible for SAP HANA  is a potential source for an Open ODS view.\n",
      "The Open ODS view accepts the following: SQL views, SAP HANA  views, tables, and virtual SAP HANA  tables \n",
      "representing a remote DB view or a remote table ( SAP HANA  smart data access).\n",
      "●The capacity of external data structures to be modeled :\n",
      "An Open ODS view assigns a source semantics (facts, master data, texts). Throughout multiple Open ODS \n",
      "views, it is therefore possible to have semantics on the same source.\n",
      "It is important for the source views to be cut in such a way that they do not contain a combination of facts and \n",
      "master data (attributes).\n",
      "●The capacity of external data to be modeled :\n",
      "An Open ODS view assigns semantics (characteristic, key figure, currency and so on) to the fields in the \n",
      "source structure. A single source field can have multiple semantics assigned to it (characteristic and key \n",
      "figure for example). Text fields can be addressed directly as texts in the BW sense. If multilingualism is \n",
      "required, text fields can be used together with other attributes in a source structure, and can be interpreted \n",
      "as such by an ODS view.\n",
      "●The integration of external data :\n",
      "Open ODS views can be associated with other Open ODS views. The association of master data Open ODS \n",
      "views with a fact Open ODS view produces a star schema for example. Open ODS views can be associated \n",
      "with InfoObjects and can thus address them directly.\n",

      "●The necessary flexibility and stability in relation to other source structures :\n",
      "The Open ODS view makes it possible to flexibly exchange source structures with one another.\n",
      "The Open ODS view supports the logical data warehouse approach, meaning that the location of the data is \n",
      "immaterial: If a service level of source A at location B is not met, the source data from A must be able to move \n",
